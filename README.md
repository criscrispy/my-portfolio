## Description
This second version aims to maximize the use of navigation, 
icons and categorization to present info in simple but intuitive way, 
thus preventing unneccessary scolling. Just like the first version, it looks great no
matter the screen size.

Modern design ideas like Neumorphism for the  Header/profile pictures and personal data 
section was applied in this project. 

### Extra info
This is an upgraded version of the simple resume I built earlier.
Link to version 1 - Github page : https://criscrispy.github.io/simple-resume/

These mini projects were inspired by LinkedIn profile page.
The projects optimize the use of space on a webpage with the implementation of cards, 
flex and layout properties to present beautiful resumes no matter the screen size.
