# simple-resume-v2

(Though complete, other changes will be added in the near future)
Github page : https://criscrispy.github.io/simple-resume-v2/
This second version aims to maximize the use of navigation ideas, 
icons and categorization to present info in simple but intuitive way, 
thus preventing unneccessary scolling. 
Modern design ideas like Neumorphism for the profile picture/personal data 
section was applied in this project. 


This is an upgraded version of the simple resume I built earlier.

These mini projects were inspired by LinkedIn profile page.
The projects optimize the use of space on a webpage with the implementation of cards, 
flex and layout properties to present beautiful resumes no matter the screen size.
