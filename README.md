## Description
This second version aims to maximize the use of navigation,\
icons and categorization to present info in simple but intuitive way, \
thus preventing unneccessary scolling. Just like the first version, it is responsive on\
all screen sizes.

Modern design ideas like Neumorphism for the  Header/profile pictures and personal data \
section was applied in this project. 

### Extra info

These mini projects were inspired by LinkedIn profile page.\
The projects optimize the use of space on a webpage with the implementation of cards,  
flex and layout properties to present beautiful resumes no matter the screen size.
